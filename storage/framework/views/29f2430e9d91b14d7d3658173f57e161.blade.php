## Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use ___SINGLE_BACKTICK___{{ $assist->artisanCommand('test --compact') }}___SINGLE_BACKTICK___ with a specific filename or filter.
