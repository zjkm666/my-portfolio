## Laravel Boost
- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan
- Use the ___SINGLE_BACKTICK___list-artisan-commands___SINGLE_BACKTICK___ tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double-check the available parameters.

## URLs
- Whenever you share a project URL with the user, you should use the ___SINGLE_BACKTICK___get-absolute-url___SINGLE_BACKTICK___ tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain/IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging
- You should use the ___SINGLE_BACKTICK___tinker___SINGLE_BACKTICK___ tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the ___SINGLE_BACKTICK___database-query___SINGLE_BACKTICK___ tool when you only need to read from the database.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)
- Boost comes with a powerful ___SINGLE_BACKTICK___search-docs___SINGLE_BACKTICK___ tool you should use before any other approaches when dealing with Laravel or Laravel ecosystem packages. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- The ___SINGLE_BACKTICK___search-docs___SINGLE_BACKTICK___ tool is perfect for all Laravel-related packages, including Laravel, Inertia, Livewire, Filament, Tailwind, Pest, Nova, Nightwatch, etc.
- You must use this tool to search for Laravel ecosystem documentation before falling back to other approaches.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries to start. For example: ___SINGLE_BACKTICK___['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']___SINGLE_BACKTICK___.
- Do not add package names to queries; package information is already shared. For example, use ___SINGLE_BACKTICK___test resource table___SINGLE_BACKTICK___, not ___SINGLE_BACKTICK___filament 4 test resource table___SINGLE_BACKTICK___.

### Available Search Syntax
- You can and should pass multiple queries at once. The most relevant results will be returned first.

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'.
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit".
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - words must be adjacent and in that order.
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit".
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms.
