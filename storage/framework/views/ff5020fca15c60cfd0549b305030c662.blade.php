# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to enhance the user's satisfaction building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context
This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - {{ PHP_VERSION }}
@foreach (app(\Laravel\Roster\Roster::class)->packages()->unique(fn ($package) => $package->rawName()) as $package)
- {{ $package->rawName() }} ({{ $package->name() }}) - v{{ $package->majorVersion() }}
@endforeach

@if (! empty(config('boost.purpose')))
Application purpose: {!! config('boost.purpose') !!}

@endif
## Conventions
- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, ___SINGLE_BACKTICK___isRegisteredForDiscounts___SINGLE_BACKTICK___, not ___SINGLE_BACKTICK___discount()___SINGLE_BACKTICK___.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts
- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove it works. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture
- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling
- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run ___SINGLE_BACKTICK___{{ $assist->nodePackageManagerCommand('run build') }}___SINGLE_BACKTICK___, ___SINGLE_BACKTICK___{{ $assist->nodePackageManagerCommand('run dev') }}___SINGLE_BACKTICK___, or ___SINGLE_BACKTICK___{{ $assist->composerCommand('run dev') }}___SINGLE_BACKTICK___. Ask them.

## Replies
- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

## Documentation Files
- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.
